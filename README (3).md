# Flappy Bird Game



## 1. Overview

This is a Flappy Bird clone created using Python and Pygame. The game features background and bird selection menus, dynamic pipe generation and movement, gravity and collision detection, score tracking, and game restart functionality.
##  2. Features
1. Background Selection: Players can choose from multiple backgrounds before starting the game.
2. Bird Selection: Players can choose their bird from a selection of different birds.
3. Dynamic Pipe Generation: Pipes are generated dynamically during gameplay.
4. Gravity and Flapping Mechanics: The bird is affected by gravity and can flap to move upward.
5. Collision Detection: The game detects collisions between the bird and pipes or the ground.
6. Score Tracking: The game tracks and displays the player's score based on the number of pipes passed.
7. Game Restart: Players can restart the game after a game-over event.
8. Pause and Unpause: The game starts paused and can be unpaused by pressing the Enter key.
9. Animations: The bird has animated flapping movements.
10. Responsive Controls: Players can control the bird using the Space key for flapping.


## 3. Installation

1. Make sure you have Python and Pygame installed on your system.
2. Download the game files and ensure all assets (images, fonts) are in the correct directories.



## 4. How to Play

1. Run the script using Python.
2. Select a background from the menu.
3. Select a bird from the menu.
4. Press Enter to start the game.
5. Use the Space key to flap the bird and navigate through the pipes.
6. Avoid collisions with the pipes and the ground.
7. Your score increases as you pass through pipes.
8. If the game ends, click "Restart" to play again.



## 5. Code Explanation

The game is built using Pygame, with key components organized into classes:

1. Pipe: Handles the creation, movement, and drawing of pipes.
2. Bird: Manages the bird's animations, gravity, flapping, and collision detection.
3. Game: Manages the overall game loop, including background and bird selection menus, updating game objects, collision checking, score tracking, and restarting the game.
The game starts with the selection menus for background and bird. Once the game starts, the bird falls due to gravity, and players can make it flap to avoid pipes. The game keeps track of the score based on the number of pipes the bird successfully passes. If the bird collides with a pipe or the ground, the game ends, and players can choose to restart.
